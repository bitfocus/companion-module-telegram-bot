## Shelly Plus Module

This module allows adding Shelly Plus devices to your Companion instance. This module is using the local WebSocket of the Shelly devices and no cloud. At the moment the following Shelly products are integrated:

- Shelly Plus 1
- Shelly Plus 1PM
- Shelly Plus 2PM (Relay Mode)
- Shelly Plus 2PM (Roller Mode)
- Shelly Pro 1
- Shelly Pro 1PM
- Shelly Pro 2
- Shelly Pro 2PM (Relay Mode)
- Shelly Pro 2PM (Roller Mode)
- Shelly Pro 3
- Shelly Pro 4PM

If you want to control older Shelly devices (without Pro or Plus in the product name) use the shelly-http module.
